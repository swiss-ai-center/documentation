# About SQLite

As the website of [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) mentions:

!!! quote

    `SQLite` is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained,
    high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

## How and why do we use SQLite

created in the database using the `SQLModel` library. We use `SQLite` for
development.
