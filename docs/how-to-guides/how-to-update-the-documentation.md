# How to update the documentation

This guide will help you in the steps to update the
[Material for MkDocs](../explanations/about-material-for-mkdocs.md)
documentation.

## Update the documentation for a new service

1. Create the page in the `docs/reference/services` directory of the
   [documentation](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/documentation) repository.
2. Add the page to the navigation in the `mkdocs.yml` file of the documentation
   repository.
3. Fill the page with the documentation for the service using an existing
   service as a reference.
4. Add the service to the index of the
   [Reference](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/documentation/blob/main/docs/reference/index.md)
   page.
5. Update your service repository to add a link to the documentation in the
   `README.md` file.
6. Update the repository details to include a quick description of the service
   and a link to the documentation as described in the
   [**How to configure a new GitHub repository > Update the repository details**](./how-to-configure-a-new-github-repository.md#update-the-repository-details).
