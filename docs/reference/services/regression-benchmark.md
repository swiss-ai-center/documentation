## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service benchmarks a dataset with various models and outputs the results
sorted by accuracy. In order for the service to work your dataset label column
must be called "target". Also to improve the results you may want to remove
uneccessary columns from the dataset. Finally, avoid having multiple empty lines
at the end of the file.

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes an image as input,
which will be used to find the average shade color in the image.
