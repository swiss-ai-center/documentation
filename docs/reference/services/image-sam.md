## Description

!!! note

    This service is the first that has his code hosted on GitLab. It uses the CI/CD
    pipeline adapted to GitLab.

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses PyTorch and OpenCV to segment everything in an image.

You can read more about the SAM model
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes an image as input,
which will be used to guess the number.
