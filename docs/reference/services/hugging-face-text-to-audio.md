## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses Hugging Face's inference API to query text-to-audio AI models.

You can choose from any model available on the inference API from the
[Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) that takes a text(JSON) as
input and outputs audio.

It must have the following JSON input structure:

```json
{
    "inputs" : "your input text"
}
```

This service takes two input files:

- A JSON file that defines the model you want to use and your access token.
- A text file.

json example:

```json
{
    "api_token": "your_token",
    "api_url": "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/musicgen-small"
}
```

This model example is a text-to-music model capable of generating music samples
conditioned on text descriptions.

input_text example:

```text
liquid drum and bass, atmospheric synths, airy sounds
```

This service creates the JSON payload from the input text and queries the given
model. The generated audio is returned in the Ogg format.

The API documentation for this service is automatically generated by FastAPI
using the OpenAPI standard. A user-friendly interface provided by Swagger is
available under the `/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are
described.
