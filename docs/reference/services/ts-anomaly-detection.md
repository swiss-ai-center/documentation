## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses
[MOMENT](https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment) to
identify anomalies in time series. The serviced provided works in a
zero-shot-fashion. However, MOMENT allows fine-tuning. If interested, check
their
[docs and tutorials](https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment/tree/main/tutorials).

!!! note

    You can download a time series sample from
	[here](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/%7Eeamonn/time_series_data_2018/).
    Choose the .csv format.

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes a mp3 file as
input, which will be analyzed.
