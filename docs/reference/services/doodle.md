This service uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to guess what a user has
drawn (in a black and white image).

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes an image as input,
which will be analyzed.
