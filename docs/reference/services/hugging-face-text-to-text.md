## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses Hugging Face's inference API to query text-to-text AI models.

You can choose from any model available on the inference API from the
[Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) that takes a text(JSON) as
input and outputs text(JSON).

It must take only one JSON input with the following structure:

```json
{
    "inputs" : "your input text"
}
```

This service takes two input files:

- A JSON file that defines the model you want to use and your access token.
- A text file.

json example:

```json
{
    "api_token": "your_token",
    "api_url": "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2",
    "desired_output": "generated_text"
}
```

In this model example, "gpt2" is used for text generation.

This service creates the JSON payload from the input text and queries the given
model. The generated text is returned as a JSON.

The API documentation for this service is automatically generated by FastAPI
using the OpenAPI standard. A user-friendly interface provided by Swagger is
available under the `/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are
described.
