## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses langchain to vectorize a pdf document into a Facebook AI
Similarity Search (FAISS) vectorstore.

FAISS is a library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of
multimedia documents that are similar to each other

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes a pdf document as
input, and then returns a zip archive containing the vectorized document.

This archive can be used in the
[chatbot-ollama service](../reference/chatbot-ollama.md/). This chatbot enables
you to ask questions about the content of the document to a large language
model.
