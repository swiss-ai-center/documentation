## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses Hugging Face's inference API to query text-to-image AI models.

You can choose from any model available on the inference API from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
that takes a text(JSON) as input and outputs an image.

It must take only one JSON input with the following structure:

```json
{
    "inputs" : "your input text"
}
```

This service takes two input files:
- A JSON file that defines the model you want to use and your access token.
- A text file.

json_description.json example:
  ```json
 {
    "api_token": "your_token",
    "api_url": "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/stabilityai/stable-cascade"
 }
 ```
input_text example:

 ```
 A majestic Hummingbird
 ```

This service creates the JSON payload with the input text and queries the given model. The generated image is returned 
as a PNG.

The API documentation for this service is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user-friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.
