## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service implements GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) on
CNN model trained for sport classification. Beside the recognition label among
100 sports, it returns a colored heatmap of the input image to underline the
pixels that actively play a role in the recognition process.

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes an image as input,
which will be analyzed.
