## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify an urban
sound. The follwowing sounds can be detected :

- air_conditioner
- car_horn
- children_playing
- dog_bark
- drilling
- engine_idling
- gun_shot
- jackhammer
- siren
- street_music

The CNN is trained on the MEL-Spectrogram of the sound sample, which transforms
the audio into a visual representation of its frequency content over time. This
allows the CNN to learn key features from both time and frequency domains,
improving its ability to recognize patterns in the audio data.

!!! note

    Urban sound samples can be download from
    [here](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound.html).

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the service are described.

This simple service only has one route `/compute` that takes a mp3 file as
input, which will be analyzed.
