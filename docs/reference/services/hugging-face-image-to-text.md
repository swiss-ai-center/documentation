## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](../core-concepts/service.md) documentation.

This service uses Hugging Face's inference API to query image-to-text AI models.

You can choose from any model available on the inference API from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
that takes an image as input and outputs text(JSON).
The model must take only one image as input.


This service takes two input files:
- A JSON file that defines the model you want to use, your access token and optionally, you can set a specific field
  from the json answer as the output. If you specify nothing, the whole json will be returned.
- The image file used as input.

json_description.json example:
 ```json
 {
     "api_token": "your_token",
     "api_url": "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base"
     "desired_output" : "generated_text"
}
```
This model example "Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base" is used for image captioning.
