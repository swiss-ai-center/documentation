## Description

!!! note

    More information about the service specification can be found in the
    [**Core concepts > Service**](https://docs.swiss-ai-center.ch/reference/core-concepts/service/) documentation.

This service performs **automatic license plate detection** on one or more input images using a YOLOv8 model that you provide.

The API expects one or more images as input and returns, for each image:

- a list of detected license plates with **bounding boxes**
- the **confidence score** of each detection
- the **crop of the detected plate** image (base64 encoded)

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI standard. A user-friendly interface is available under the `/docs` route, where the endpoints are described.

---

## Usage

### Input

The `/compute` endpoint accepts a set of input images. Each image should be provided as base64 data.

### Output

For each input image, the service returns:

- bounding box coordinates of plates,
- confidence values,
- class label (e.g., “license_plate”),
- cropped plate images (base64 encoded),
- summary per image.

Request and response formats are visible in the auto-generated API docs at the `/docs` route.
