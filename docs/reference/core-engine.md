The Core engine allows to create and manage pipelines of microservices.

The Core engine is split in two main services:

- [Core engine Backend](#backend) - The API to register services and create
  pipelines
- [Core engine Frontend](#frontend) - The user interface to interact with the
  backend

Another service is available, [Glitchtip](TODO), to centralize the logging
errors thrown by the Core engine and its services.

## Backend

The Core engine Backend is built using Python 3.10, FastAPI, SQLModel and
Domain-driven design.

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI using the OpenAPI
standard. A user-friendly interface provided by Swagger is available under the
`/docs` route, where the endpoints of the services are described.

### Environment variables

All environment variables are described in the
[`.env`](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/core-engine/blob/main/core-engine/.env)
file.

The environment variables can be overwritten during the CI/CD pipeline described
in the
[`backend.yml`](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/core-engine/blob/main/.github/workflows/backend.yml)
GitHub workflow file.

### Run the tests with Python

!!! info

    You might need to initialize a virtual environment before running the tests.

    Check the
    [**Start the Core engine locally > Start the Core engine locally with plain Python and Node.js**](#start-the-core-engine-locally)
    to initialize and activate a virtual environment.

For each module a test file is available to check the correct behavior of the
code. The tests are run using the `pytest` library with code coverage check. To
run the tests, use the following command inside the `src` folder:

```sh
# Run the tests
pytest
```

## Frontend

The Frontend is built using React and TypeScript.

### Environment variables

All environment variables are described in the
[`.env`](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/core-engine/blob/main/frontend/.env)
file.

The environment variables can be overwritten during the CI/CD pipeline described
in the
[`frontend.yml`](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/core-engine/blob/main/.github/workflows/frontend.yml)
GitHub workflow file.

### Build the application

In the `frontend` directory, build the Core engine Frontend with the following
commands.

```sh
# Install the dependencies
npm ci

# Build the Core engine Frontend
npm run build
```

The output of the build is in the `build` directory.

Once a React application is built, the environment variables cannot be changed.

### Build and run the Docker image

In order to build the Docker image, the application must be
[built](#build-the-application) beforehand. Then, the Docker image can be built
with the following commands.

```sh
# Build the Docker image with a tag
docker build -t swiss-ai-center/core-engine-frontend .

# Run the Docker image
docker run -p 3000:80 swiss-ai-center/core-engine-frontend
```

The Core engine Frontend is available on <http://localhost:3000>.

> **Q**: _Why don't we build the React application within the Docker image?_
>
> **A**: This setup allows us to speed up the build process of the Docker image:
> it does not need to download and install all dependencies every time the
> `package.json` file is updated. In a CI/CD set up, the `node_modules` can be
> cached in the `build` stage and the output can be passed to the `publish`
> stage.

## Start the Core engine locally

!!! tip

    If you are not familiar with the Core engine and its services, we recommend to
    follow the [**Getting started**](../tutorials/getting-started.md) guide first.
